    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hi! I’m Rhey, the creator of Get to Know Your Politicians. This website is a fun project I started to
        combine my love for technology and interest in civic engagement. The goal? To create a space where people can
        quickly learn about their leaders in a simple, balanced, and engaging way.

    <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
    <p>Politics can be overwhelming, and I wanted to make it easier for people to understand who their leaders are,
        what they stand for, and how they perform. This is my small way of encouraging awareness and informed
        decision-making. Plus, it’s a fun way for me to practice web development and share something useful!

        How It Works
    <p>I’ve kept things simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browse through politicians’ profiles.</li>
        <li>Check their ratings and a quick list of pros and cons.</li>
        <li>Share your thoughts and feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>A Personal Note</h2>
    <p>This is a solo project, so things might not be perfect, but I’m learning and improving as I go. If you have
    ideas, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out!</p>
